                    Mana Rumble was our final project during our Computer Science studies in Reykjav√≠k University. It was developed using Unity while utilising Rewired so that two players can use separate controllers on the same machine.
                <p>
                    Mana Rumble is a team based PVP fantasy sports game, utilising a simplified version of handball while allowing the player to control any of 3 characters, each with an ability based on fantasy classes found in fantasy roleplaying games.

It was thought up as I was watching long YouTube videos and realising I was going to go do something but not wanting to pause there and then. I then realised that the video I was watching had chapters and it would be cool if I could stop the video when the next chapter started.
